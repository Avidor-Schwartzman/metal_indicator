## How to run

## Project plans

- bug: deal with uppercase, lowercase, etc. in input: "Tool" should say True, not False
- feature: add more bands
- feature: when the band is not metal, write False but when the indicator doesn't know the band write "Don't know"
- feature: Add emojis to output
- Feature (long term): In the far future, we want to search the bands online!
